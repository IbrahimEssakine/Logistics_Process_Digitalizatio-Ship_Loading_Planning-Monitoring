# Introduction
OCP, a global leader in phosphate production, faces crucial logistics challenges due to rising demand for agricultural fertilizers. Optimizing logistics processes is vital for competitiveness. Digitalizing planning and operations tracking allows for quick strategy adjustments to market changes, providing increased supply chain visibility.

Our DMAIC-guided approach includes:
  1.Analysis of challenges and opportunities.
  2.Recommendations for tracking, design of a traceability platform, and mathematical modeling for planning optimization.

# Analysis of Stops
Identifying the drawbacks of the current planning tool highlights the need for an in-depth analysis of loading stoppages. An ABC analysis can pinpoint and prioritize the most significant issues. By focusing on major contributors, efforts can be directed for maximum impact. We conducted an ABC analysis and created a Power BI dashboard to examine key causes, stoppage numbers, and affected ships by stock, crane, fertilizer type, and more.

## Mathematical modeling

Mathematical modeling for daily loading planning involves defining parameters (such as capacity and costs), decision variables (like quantities and schedules), constraints (such as time and resource limits), and an objective function (such as minimizing costs or maximizing efficiency). The complexity of the model depends on the number of variables and constraints involved. Optimization engines, such as linear programming solvers or heuristic algorithms, are used to find the best solution. Simulation techniques may also be employed to test and refine solutions under different scenarios, ensuring robustness and efficiency in daily loading operations.
